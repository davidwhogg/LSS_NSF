\section{Introduction}

The cold-dark-matter-with-a-cosmological-constant (\LCDM) model is
very well established observationally, having explained many different
kinds of data with a small number of free parameters, and having made
some ab-initio predictions (like the baryon acoustic feature; CITE)
prior to the observations.
It's almost certainly \emph{not the true model}.
It seems unlikely that the dark sector is a single species, with no
non-gravitational interactions, and no interesting thermodymamic or
dynamical features.
However, what is well established is the following:
Whatever \emph{is} the true model \emph{is very well approximated} by
\LCDM\ over a wide range of scales in length and density.
So the \LCDM\ deserves our respect and our attention.
And it also deserves our criticism and our scrutiny.
Here we proceed with both.

In addition to the importance and success of the \LCDM\ model---or
really because of it---the principal cosmological parameters (which
can be thought of as the age, the densities in various components, and
the power spectrum of the initial conditions) are measured in data
with percent-level precision.
And maybe the over-arching theme of astrophysics, historically, is
that with new precision comes new opportunities!
The current and next generations of surveys hope to
make measurements of effects which enter at sub-percent levels:
For example, it's looking likely that we can measure the total mass in
neutrinos just from observations of large-scale structure and the
cosmic microwave background, when this is truly a trace component,
dynamically.
This would answer questions that direct mass measurement experiments
can't answer yet, or ever if there are contributions from sterile
neutrinos.
For another example, if the cosmological constant turns out to be a particle rather
than a term in general relativity, we now know, observationally, that
the differences that makes will appear at sub-percent level in the
expansion history and the growth of structure.

For us, these are just examples of things we might be doing in the
coming decade.
Here we propose to design, build, and exercise tools that will be
valuable no matter what the questions of cosmology become.
In our view, given the success and precision of the current
cosmological model, new projects either have to obtain
\textbf{substantially more precision}, or else look for subtle
\textbf{departures from predictions}.
That is, we want to see small effects, and in particular, small
effects that might call into question the deep assumptions of the
\LCDM\ model.

Doing better than has ever been done before will require work along
multiple axes.
The first axis is \emph{volume}: We need to observe more volume. This
is happening now, with projects like HOGG, KSF: PROJECT LIST WITH
CITATIONS.
But of course this new volume comes at a cost: As we look to larger
distances and larger volumes with denser tracers, we push our
observations to noisier targets with less-well-measured individual
properties.
That is, as the data get better in a global sense (more volume, more
modes measured), it gets worse in an individual-object sense (fewer
bits per target, more contamination from foregrounds and backgrounds).

This all leads to the second axis along which we have to work, which
is calibration, contamination, and window functions:
As the data get harder to use at the individual-object level, it is
harder to know that we have surveyed the volume uniformly, or, more
importantly, do we understand the non-uniformity of our sampling?
Survey window function knowledge starts to depend on things about the
observational projects that we can't know well, like small-scale
variations of the point-spread function or temporal variability of the
photometric bandpasses.
In this context we are pushed to data-driven techniques for
understanding the selection, which connect to ideas of
self-calibration, where the PI has been a pioneer.

And the third axis is statistical sophistication.

As we simultaneously move to higher precision requirements, and larger
volumes of data, and with lower-precision individual-object data

...HOGG

This proposal is to build and exercise general-purpose tools that will
make the next generation of (galaxy, quasar, and intensity-mapping)
large-scale structure (\LSS) surveys more precise, more powerful, and
more capable of making truly new discoveries.
The project has three themes, which connect to the three axes above in
various ways.
In the first theme, we replace the standard estimator for clustering or
correlation functions with something far more flexible, which permits us
to do more with more cosmological volume at fixed computation.
In the second, we analyze, attack, and re-build the self-calibration 
methods for window function estimation.
In the third, we perform a very false-positive-safe search for anomalies
in the large-scale structure, to identify departures that might point to
new physics.

\section{A new estimator for galaxy clustering}

KSF: I have copied in what I wrote in the summary, but can ou replace
this with two-ish pages about what we are doing and why?

The project will build and operate a new estimator for
galaxy clustering that obviates binning of objects (galaxies or
quasars or pixels) or pairs into bins; instead it estimates continuous
functional forms for clustering as a function of scale, galaxy mass,
color, and so on.
These continuous functional forms make a better representation of the
clustering than any binning; therefore this estimator can do more with
fewer clustering-model components.
This in turn lets it make more powerful measurements with less data,
and with less of the computation that is used to do uncertainty
propagation.

Call out \textbf{Intellectual merit}.
This project will deliver both general methods and specific, released,
open-source code that works efficiently on current data and can be
incorporated into current and future analysis pipelines. And: less computing!

Call out \textbf{Broader impacts}.

\section{Adversarial approaches to systematics}



The project will build adversarial simulated data that is
designed to defeat current methodologies for finding and correcting
systematic effects of calibration and target selection in \LSS\ 
surveys. And then build far more general calibration
programs, based on non-parametric models, that can defeat the
adversaries.

Call out \textbf{Intellectual merit}.
This project will make NSF-funded cosmology projects (including
\SDSSIV, \DESI, and \LSST) more productive, more precise, and more
capable of making ground-breaking discoveries.

\section{Searches for anomalies}

The project will build methodologies that perform (and perform
ourselves) statistically principled brute-force searches of \LSS\ 
surveys (current and future) for theory-motivated departures from
predictions of the \LCDM\ model.
The cosmological model is very successful.
But the discovery of a departure at intermediate-to-large scales
(where the physical model is extremely accurate) would be so important
and significant that it is worth investing effort here.
The principled aspects of the project will include pre-registration of
hypotheses (that is, an enumeration of the specific forms and kinds of
deviations) prior to search.
And this tool category is related to the previous two, because we need
to distinguish small departures from systematic effects, and we need
to extract signatures at bound-saturating precision.

Call out \textbf{Intellectual merit}.
This project will establish methods for pre-registration of hypotheses that
will be of general value in cosmology and other areas in the natural
sciences.

Call out \textbf{Broader impacts}.

\section{Workshops and pedagogical publications}

In executing the project, the investigators will build curricular
materials for undergraduate-to-PhD bridge programs, preparing students
in the physical sciences to have better data-science and statistics
skills and therefore better PhD preparations.
We will test and refine these curricular materials in workshops for
students of broad backgrounds in New York City.

Call out \textbf{Intellectual merit}.

\section{Relevance to NSF priorities and programs}

HOGG CHECK THIS:
In addition to being relevant to \NSF\ Division \acronym{AST}, this project also
connects to Divisions \acronym{OAC} and \acronym{IIS}, and touches on the \NSF\ theme
Harnessing the Data Revolution.

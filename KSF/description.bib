abstract = {We present a one per cent measurement of the cosmic distance scale from the detections of the baryon acoustic oscillations in the clustering of galaxies from the Baryon Oscillation Spec-troscopic Survey (BOSS), which is part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III). Our results come from the Data Release 11 (DR11) sample, containing nearly one million galax-ies and covering approximately 8 500 square degrees and the redshift range 0.2 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.7. We also compare these results with those from the publicly released DR9 and DR10 samples. Assuming a concordance $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model, the DR11 sample covers a volume of 13 Gpc 3 and is the largest region of the Universe ever surveyed at this density. We mea-sure the correlation function and power spectrum, including density-field reconstruction of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature. The acoustic features are detected at a sig-nificance of over 7 $\sigma$ in both the correlation function and power spectrum. Fitting for the position of the acoustic features measures the distance relative to the sound horizon at the drag epoch, r d , which has a value of r d,fid = 149.28 Mpc in our fiducial cosmology. We find D V = (1264 ± 25 Mpc)(r d /r d,fid) at z = 0.32 and D V = (2056 ± 20 Mpc)(r d /r d,fid) at z = 0.57. At 1.0 per cent, this latter measure is the most precise distance constraint ever obtained from a galaxy survey. Separating the clustering along and transverse to the line-of-sight yields measurements at z = 0.57 of D A = (1421 ± 20 Mpc)(r d /r d,fid) and H = (96.8 ± 3.4 km/s/Mpc)(r d,fid /r d). Our measurements of the distance scale are in good agreement with previous BAO measurements and with the predictions from cosmic mi-crowave background data for a spatially flat cold dark matter model with a cosmological constant.},

abstract = {We describe a strategy for constructing a neural network jet substructure tagger which powerfully discriminates boosted decay signals while remaining largely uncorrelated with the jet mass. This reduces the impact of systematic uncertainties in background modeling while enhancing signal purity, resulting in improved discovery significance relative to existing taggers. The network is trained using an adversarial strategy, resulting in a tagger that learns to balance classification accuracy with decorrelation. As a benchmark scenario, we consider the case where large-radius jets originating from a boosted resonance decay are discriminated from a background of nonresonant quark and gluon jets. We show that in the presence of systematic uncertainties on the background rate, our adversarially-trained, decorrelated tagger considerably outperforms a conventionally trained neural network, despite having a slightly worse signal-background separation power. We generalize the adversarial training technique to include a parametric dependence on the signal hypothesis, training a single network that provides optimized, interpolatable decorrelated jet tagging across a continuous range of hypothetical resonance masses, after training on discrete choices of the signal mass.},

abstract = {Transmission spectroscopy, which consists of measuring the wavelength-dependent absorption of starlight by a planet's atmosphere during a transit, is a powerful probe of atmospheric composition. However, the expected signal is typically orders of magnitude smaller than instrumental systematics, and the results are crucially dependent on the treatment of the latter. In this paper, we propose a new method to infer transit parameters in the presence of systematic noise using Gaussian processes, a technique widely used in the machine learning community for Bayesian regression and classification problems. Our method makes use of auxiliary information about the state of the instrument, but does so in a non-parametric manner, without imposing a specific dependence of the systematics on the instrumental parameters, and naturally allows for the correlated nature of the noise. We give an example application of the method to archival NICMOS transmission spectroscopy of the hot Jupiter HD 189733, which goes some way towards reconciling the controversy surrounding this dataset in the literature. Finally, we provide an appendix giving a general introduction to Gaussian processes for regression, in order to encourage their application to a wider range of problems.},

abstract = {We investigate the possibility of detecting in redshift surveys a hemispherical power asymmetry similar to that first reported in CMB observations. We assume the hemispherical asymmetry arises from a linear gradient in comoving coordinates in the perturbation amplitude. We predict the resulting clustering of galaxy or galaxy cluster tracers using an excursion set approach; doing so accounts for the variation of both the underlying clustering and the tracer bias. Based on the predicted variation of the clustering of tracers, we perform a Fisher matrix forecast of the galaxy clustering amplitude and calculate the statistical significance for ideal surveys and planned surveys. The results indicate that the DESI galaxy survey would be able to detect this signal with higher than {\$}3\backslashsigma{\$} significance if the asymmetry does exist. We also investigate the amplitude and scale dependence of the above result. The DESI galaxy survey can probe the dipole amplitude higher than 0.04, which correspond to a {\$}\backslashpm4\backslash{\%}{\$} difference of the temperature fluctuation along and opposite the dipole direction, at least at the {\$}2\backslashsigma{\$} level. Additionally, we investigate a modulation of the power spectrum that exhibits asymmetry only for large scales. This modulation is potentially detectable. For Milky Way galaxy mass tracers, the scale-dependent modulation yields a larger change in the large scale power spectrum than does a scale-independent modulation, because the former does not alter the bias.},

abstract = {We present K2SC (K2 Systematics Correction), a Python pipeline to model instrumental systematics and astrophysical variability in light curves from the K2 mission. K2SC uses Gaussian process regression to model position-dependent systematics and time-dependent variability simultaneously, enabling the user to remove both (e.g., for transit searches) or to remove systematics while preserving variability (for variability studies). For periodic variables, K2SC automatically computes estimates of the period, amplitude and evolution timescale of the variability. We apply K2SC to publicly available K2 data from campaigns 3--5, showing that we obtain photometric precision approaching that of the original Kepler mission. We compare our results to other publicly available K2 pipelines, showing that we obtain similar or better results, on average. We use transit injection and recovery tests to evaluate the impact of K2SC on planetary transit searches in K2 PDC (Pre-search Data Conditioning) data, for planet-to-star radius ratios down Rp/Rstar = 0.01 and periods up to P = 40 d, and show that K2SC significantly improves the ability to distinguish between correct and false detections, particularly for small planets. K2SC can be run automatically on many light curves, or manually tailored for specific objects such as pulsating stars or large amplitude eclipsing binaries. It can be run on ASCII and FITS light curve files, regardless of their origin. Both the code and the processed light curves are publicly available, and we provide instructions for downloading and using them. The methodology used by K2SC will be applicable to future transit search missions such as TESS and PLATO.},

abstract = {Euclid is an ESA Cosmic-Vision wide-field-space mission which is designed to explain the origin of the acceleration of Universe expansion. The mission will investigate at the same time two primary cosmological probes: Weak gravitational Lensing (WL) and Galaxy Clustering (in particular Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, BAO). The extreme precision requested on primary science objectives can only be achieved by observing a large number of galaxies distributed over the whole sky in order to probe the distribution of dark matter and galaxies at all scales. The extreme accuracy needed requires observation from space to limit all observational biases in the measurements. The definition of the Euclid survey, aiming at detecting billions of galaxies over 15 000 square degrees of the extragalactic sky, is a key parameter of the mission. It drives its scientific potential, its duration and the mass of the spacecraft. The construction of a Reference Survey derives from the high level science requirements for a Wide and a Deep survey. The definition of a main sequence of observations and the associated calibrations were indeed a major achievement of the Definition Phase. Implementation of this sequence demonstrated the feasibility of covering the requested area in less than 6 years while taking into account the overheads of space segment observing and maneuvering sequence. This reference mission will be used for sizing the spacecraft consumables needed for primary science. It will also set the framework for optimizing the time on the sky to fulfill the primary science and maximize the Euclid legacy.},

abstract = {The dark energy plus cold dark matter (CDM) cosmological model has been a demonstrably successful framework for predicting and explaining the large-scale structure of the Universe and its evolution with time. Yet on length scales smaller than ∼1 Mpc and mass scales smaller than ∼10 11 M , the theory faces a number of challenges. For example, the observed cores of many dark matter–dominated galaxies are both less dense and less cuspy than navely predicted in CDM. The number of small galaxies and dwarf satel-lites in the Local Group is also far below the predicted count of low-mass dark matter halos and subhalos within similar volumes. These issues under-lie the most well-documented problems with CDM: cusp/core, missing satellites, and too-big-to-fail. The key question is whether a better under-standing of baryon physics, dark matter physics, or both is required to meet these challenges. Other anomalies, including the observed planar and orbital configurations of Local Group satellites and the tight baryonic/dark matter scaling relations obeyed by the galaxy population, have been less thoroughly explored in the context of CDM theory. Future surveys to discover faint, distant dwarf galaxies and to precisely measure their masses and density struc-ture hold promising avenues for testing possible solutions to the small-scale challenges going forward. Observational programs to constrain or discover and characterize the number of truly dark low-mass halos are among the most important, and achievable, goals in this field over the next decade. These efforts will either further verify the CDM paradigm or demand a substantial revision in our understanding of the nature of dark matter.},

abstract = {The effect of baryons on the matter power spectrum is likely to have an observable effect for future galaxy surveys, like Euclid or LSST. As a first step towards a fully predictive theory, we investigate the effect of non-radiative hydrodynamics on the structure of galaxy groups sized halos, which contribute the most to the weak lensing power spectrum. We perform high resolution (more than one million particles per halo and one kilo-parsec resolution) non-radiative hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations of a sample of 16 halos, comparing the profiles to popular analytical models. We find that the total mass profile is well fitted by a Navarro, Frenk {\&} White model, with parameters slightly modified from the dark matter only simulation. We also find that the Komatsu {\&} Seljak hydrostatic solution provides a good fit to the gas profiles, with however significant deviations, arising from strong turbulent mixing in the core and from non-thermal, turbulent pressure support in the outskirts. The turbulent energy follows a shallow, rising linear profile with radius, and correlates with the halo formation time. Using only three main structural halo parameters as variables (total mass, concentration parameter and central gas density), we can predict with an accuracy better than 20{\%} the individual gas density and temperature profiles. For the average total mass profile, which is relevant for power spectrum calculations, we even reach an accuracy of 1{\%}. The robustness of these predictions has been tested against resolution effects, different types of initial conditions and hydrodynamical schemes.},

abstract = {Measuring the two-point correlation function of the galaxies in the Universe gives access to the underlying dark matter distribution, which is related to cosmological parameters and to the physics of the primordial Universe. The estimation of the correlation function for current galaxy surveys makes use of the Landy-Szalay estimator, which is supposed to reach minimal variance. This is only true, however, for a vanishing correlation function. We study the Landy-Szalay estimator when these conditions are not fulfilled and propose a new estimator that provides the smallest variance for a given survey geometry. Our estimator is a linear combination of ratios between paircounts of data and/or random catalogues (DD, RR and DR). The optimal combination for a given geometry is determined by using lognormal mock catalogues. The resulting estimator is biased in a model-dependent way, but we propose a simple iterative procedure for obtaining an unbiased model-independent estimator. Our method can be easily applied to any dataset and requires few extra mock catalogues compared to the standard Landy-Szalay analysis. Using various sets of simulated data (lognormal, second-order LPT and N-Body), we obtain a 20-25{\%} gain on the error bars on the two-point correlation function for the SDSS geometry and $\Lambda$CDM correlation function. When applied to SDSS data (DR7 and DR9), we achieve a similar gain on the correlation functions, which translates into a 10-15{\%} improvement over the estimation of the densities of matter Ωm and dark energy Ω$\Lambda$ in an open $\Lambda$CDM model.

abstract = {The main foundations of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model of cosmology are that: (1) the redshifts of the galaxies are due to the expansion of the Universe plus peculiar motions; (2) the cosmic microwave background radiation and its anisotropies derive from the high energy primordial Universe when matter and radiation became decoupled; (3) the abundance pattern of the light elements is explained in terms of primordial nucleosynthesis; and (4) the formation and evolution of galaxies can be explained only in terms of gravitation within a inflation + dark matter + dark energy scenario. Numerous tests have been carried out on these ideas and, although the standard model works pretty well in fitting many observations, there are also many data that present apparent caveats to be understood with it. In this paper, I offer a review of these tests and problems, as well as some examples of alternative models.},

The ML estimator outperforms the LS estimator in that it results in smaller measurement errors at any fixed random point density. Put another way, the ML estimator can reach the same precision as the LS estimator with a significantly smaller random point catalog. Moreover, these gains are achieved without significantly increasing the computational requirements for estimating {\{}$\backslash$xi{\}}. We quantify the relative improvement of the ML estimator over the LS estimator, and discuss the regimes under which these improvements are most significant. We present a short guide on how to implement the ML estimator, and emphasize that the code alterations required to switch from a LS to a ML estimator are minimal.},

Using analytic arguments and N-body simulations, we calculate the mass function and clustering of dark matter halos across a range of redshifts and levels of nongaussianity. We propose a simple fitting function for the mass function valid across the entire range of our simulations. We find pronounced effects of nongaussianity on the clustering of dark matter halos, leading to strongly scale-dependent bias. This suggests that the large-scale clustering of rare objects may provide a sensitive probe of primordial nongaussianity. We very roughly estimate that upcoming surveys can constrain nongaussianity at the level |fNL| {\textless}{\~{}} 10, competitive with forecasted constraints from the microwave background.},

abstract = {The Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) is a 2.4m space telescope with a 0.281 deg{\^{}}2 field of view for near-IR imaging and slitless spectroscopy and a coronagraph designed for {\textgreater} 10{\^{}}8 starlight suppresion. As background information for Astro2020 white papers, this article summarizes the current design and anticipated performance of WFIRST. While WFIRST does not have the UV imaging/spectroscopic capabilities of the Hubble Space Telescope, for wide field near-IR surveys WFIRST is hundreds of times more efficient. Some of the most ambitious multi-cycle HST Treasury programs could be executed as routine General Observer (GO) programs on WFIRST. The large area and time-domain surveys planned for the cosmology and exoplanet microlensing programs will produce extraordinarily rich data sets that enable an enormous range of Archival Research (AR) investigations. Requirements for the coronagraph are defined based on its status as a technology demonstration, but its expected performance will enable unprecedented observations of nearby giant exoplanets and circumstellar disks. WFIRST is currently in the Preliminary Design and Technology Completion phase (Phase B), on schedule for launch in 2025, with several of its critical components already in production.},

abstract = {Second-order measures, such as the two-point correlation function, are geometrical quantities describing the clustering properties of a point distribution. In this article well-known estimators for the correlation integral are reviewed and their relation to geometrical estimators for the two-point correlation function is put forward. Simulations illustrate the range of applicability of these estimators. The interpretation of the two-point correlation function as the excess of clustering with respect to Poisson distributed points has led to biases in common estimators. Comparing with the approximately unbiased geometrical estimators, we show how biases enter the estimators introduced by Davis and Peebles, Landy and Szalay, and Hamilton. We give recommendations for the application of the estimators, including details of the numerical implementation. The properties of the estimators of the correlation integral are illustrated in an application to a sample of IRAS galaxies. It is found that, due to the limitations of current galaxy catalogues in number and depth, no reliable determination of the correlation integral on large scales is possible. In the sample of IRAS galaxies considered, several estimators using different finite-size corrections yield different results on scales larger than 20 Mpc/h, while all of them agree on smaller scales.},

@article{PlanckCollaboration2013,
abstract = {The two fundamental assumptions of the standard cosmological model - that the initial fluctuations are statistically isotropic and Gaussian - are rigorously tested using maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy from the Planck satellite. Deviations from isotropy have been found and demonstrated to be robust against component separation algorithm, mask choice and frequency dependence. Many of these anomalies were previously observed in the WMAP data, and are now confirmed at similar levels of significance (about 3 sigma). However, we find little evidence for non-Gaussianity, with the exception of a few statistical signatures that seem to be associated with specific anomalies. In particular, we find that the quadrupole-octopole alignment is also connected to a low observed variance of the CMB signal. A power asymmetry is now found to persist to scales corresponding to about l=600, and can be described in the low-l regime by a phenomenological dipole modulation model. However, any primordial power asymmetry is strongly scale-dependent and does not extend to arbitrarily small angular scales. Finally, it is plausible that some of these features may be reflected in the angular power spectrum of the data, which shows a deficit of power on similar scales. Indeed, when the power spectra of two hemispheres defined by a preferred direction are considered separately, one shows evidence for a deficit in power, while its opposite contains oscillations between odd and even modes that may be related to the parity violation and phase correlations also detected in the data. Although these analyses represent a step forward in building an understanding of the anomalies, a satisfactory explanation based on physically motivated models is still lacking.},

abstract = {The standard siren approach of gravitational wave cosmology appeals to the direct luminosity distance estimation through the waveform signals from inspiralling double compact binaries, especially those with electromagnetic counterparts providing redshifts. It is limited by the calibration uncertainties in strain amplitude and relies on the fine details of the waveform. The Einstein telescope is expected to produce 104-105 gravitational wave detections per year, 50-100 of which will be lensed. Here, we report a waveform-independent strategy to achieve precise cosmography by combining the accurately measured time delays from strongly lensed gravitational wave signals with the images and redshifts observed in the electromagnetic domain. We demonstrate that just 10 such systems can provide a Hubble constant uncertainty of 0.68{\%} for a flat lambda cold dark matter universe in the era of third-generation ground-based detectors.},

abstract = {We investigate the effects of potential sources of systematic error on the angular and photometric redshift, z phot , distributions of a sample of redshift 0.4 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.7 massive galaxies whose selection matches that of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) constant mass sample. Utilizing over 112,778 BOSS spectra as a training sample, we produce a photometric redshift catalog for the galaxies in the SDSS DR8 imaging area that, after masking, covers nearly one quarter of the sky (9,913 square degrees). We investigate fluctuations in the number density of objects in this sample as a function of Galactic extinction, seeing, stellar density, sky background, airmass, photometric offset, and North/South Galactic hemisphere. We find that the presence of stars of comparable magnitudes to our galaxies (which are not traditionally masked) effectively remove area. Failing to correct for such stars can produce systematic errors on the measured angular auto-correlation function, w($\theta$), that are larger than its statistical uncertainty. We describe how one can effectively mask for the presence of the 2 A. J. Ross et al. stars, without removing any galaxies from the sample, and minimize the systematic error. Additionally, we apply two separate methods that can be used to correct the systematic errors imparted by any parameter that can be turned into a map on the sky. We find that failing to properly account for varying sky background introduces a systematic error on w($\theta$). We measure w($\theta$), in four z phot slices of width 0.05 between 0.45 {\textless} z phot {\textless} 0.65 and find that the measurements, after correcting for the systematic effects of stars and sky background, are generally consistent with a generic $\Lambda$CDM model, at scales up to 60 o. At scales greater than 3 o and z phot {\textgreater} 0.5, the magnitude of the corrections we apply are greater than the statistical uncertainty in w($\theta$). The photometric redshift catalog we produce will be made publicly available at http://portal.nersc.gov/project/boss/galaxy/photoz/.},

abstract = {We study the luminosity and color dependence of the galaxy 2-point correlation function in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, starting from a sample of 200,000 galaxies over 2500 deg{\^{}}2. We concentrate on the projected correlation function w(r{\_}p), which is directly related to the real space $\backslash$xi(r). The amplitude of w(r{\_}p) grows continuously with luminosity, rising more steeply above the characteristic luminosity L{\_}*. Redder galaxies exhibit a higher amplitude and steeper correlation function at all luminosities. The correlation amplitude of blue galaxies increases continuously with luminosity, but the luminosity dependence for red galaxies is less regular, with bright red galaxies more strongly clustered at large scales and faint red galaxies more strongly clustered at small scales. We interpret these results using halo occupation distribution (HOD) models assuming concordance cosmological parameters. For most samples, an HOD model with two adjustable parameters fits the w(r{\_}p) data better than a power-law, explaining inflections at r{\_}p {\~{}} 1-3 Mpc/h as the transition between the 1-halo and 2-halo regimes of $\backslash$xi(r). The implied minimum mass for a halo hosting a central galaxy above a luminosity threshold L grows as M{\_}min {\~{}} L at low luminosities and more steeply above L{\_}*. The mass at which an average halo has one satellite galaxy brighter than L is M{\_}1 {\~{}} 23 M{\_}min(L). These results imply a conditional luminosity function (at fixed halo mass) in which central galaxies lie far above a Schechter function extrapolation of the satellite population. HOD models nicely explain the joint luminosity-color dependence of w(r{\_}p) in terms of the color fractions of central and satellite populations as a function of halo mass. The inferred HOD properties are in good qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions.},

An estimator of the two-point correlation function is constructed by contrasting the observed distribution of galaxies with that of a uniformly populated random catalog. Using the assumption that the distribution of random galaxies in redshift is independent of angular position allows us to replace pairwise combinatorics with fast integration over probability maps. The new method significantly reduces the computation time while simultaneously increasing the precision of the calculation. It also allows to introduce cosmological parameters only at the last and least computationally expensive stage, which is helpful when exploring various choices for these parameters.},

abstract = {We investigate spatially flat isotropic cosmological models which contain a scalar field with an exponential potential and a perfect fluid with a linear equation of state. We include an interaction term, through which the energy of the scalar field is transferred to the matter fields, consistent with a term that arises from scalar-tensor theory under a conformal transformation and field redefinition. The governing ordinary differential equations reduce to a dynamical system when appropriate normalized variables are defined. We analyze the dynamical system and find that the interaction term can significantly affect the qualitative behavior of the models. The late-time behavior of these models may be of cosmological interest. In particular, for a specific range of values for the model parameters there are late-time attracting solutions, corresponding to a novel attracting equilibrium point, which are inflationary and in which the scalar field's energy-density remains a fixed fraction of the matter field's energy density. These scalar field models may be of interest as late-time cosmologies, particularly in view of the recent observations of the current accelerated cosmic expansion. For appropriate values of the interaction coupling parameter, this equilibrium point is an attracting focus, and hence as inflating solutions approach this late-time attractor the scalar field oscillates. Hence these models may also be of importance in the study of inflation in the early universe. {\textcopyright} 2000 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {African Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans are historically underrepresented minorities (URMs) among science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) degree earners. Viewed from a perspective of social influence, this pattern suggests that URMs do not integrate into the STEM academic community at the same rate as non-URM students. Estrada and colleagues recently showed that Kelman's tripartite integration model of social influence (TIMSI) predicted URM persistence into science fields. In this paper, we longitudinally examine the integration of URMs into the STEM community by using growth-curve analyses to measure the development of TIMIS's key variables (science efficacy, identity, and values) from junior year through the postbaccalaureate year. Results showed that quality mentorship and research experience occurring in the junior and senior years were positively related to student science efficacy, identity, and values at that same time period. Longitudinal modeling of TIMSI further shows that, while efficacy is important, and perhaps a necessary predictor of moving toward a STEM career, past experiences of efficacy may not be sufficient for maintaining longer-term persistence. In contrast, science identity and values do continue to be predictive of STEM career pathway persistence up to 4 years after graduation.},

abstract = {We examine the correlation function $\xi$ of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Luminous Red Galaxy sample at large scales (60 h -1 Mpc {\textless} s {\textless} 400 h -1 Mpc) using the final data release (DR7). Focusing on a quasi-volume-limited (0.16 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.36) subsample and utilizing mock galaxy catalogs, we demonstrate that the observed baryonic acoustic peak and larger scale signal are consistent with $\Lambda$CDM at 70{\%}-95{\%} confidence. Fitting data to a non-linear, redshift-space, template-based model, we constrain the peak position at s p = 101.7± 3.0 h -1 Mpc when fitting the range 60 h -1 Mpc {\textless} s {\textless} 150 h -1 Mpc (1$\sigma$ uncertainties). This redshift-space distance s p is related to the comoving sound horizon scale rs after taking into account matter-clustering non-linearities, redshift distortions, and galaxy-clustering bias. Mock catalogs show that the probability that a DR7-sized sample would not have an identifiable peak is at least {\~{}}10{\%}. As a consistency check of a fiducial cosmology, we use the observed s p to obtain the distance D{\_}V≡ ((1+z){\^{}}2D{\_}A{\^{}}2cz/H(z)){\^{}}{\{}{\{}1{\}}/{\{}3{\}}{\}} relative to the acoustic scale. We find rs /DV (z = 0.278) = 0.1389 ± 0.0043. This result is in excellent agreement with Percival et al., who examine roughly the same data set, but use the power spectrum. Comparison with other determinations in the literature are also in very good agreement. The signal of the full sample at 125 h -1 Mpc {\textless} s {\textless} 200 h -1 Mpc tends to be high relative to theoretical expectations; this slight deviation can probably be attributed to sample variance. We have tested our results against a battery of possible systematic effects, finding all effects are smaller than our estimated sample variance.},

Skillfully using data science tools that manage this complexity requires training in new programming languages and frameworks as well as immersion in new modes of interaction that foster data sharing, collaborative software development, and exchange across disciplines. Learning these skills from traditional university curricula can be challenging because most courses are not designed to evolve on time scales that can keep pace with rapidly shifting data science methods. Here, we present the concept of a hack week as an effective model offering opportunities for networking and community building, education in state-of-the-art data science methods, and immersion in collaborative project work. We find that hack weeks are successful at cultivating collaboration and facilitating the exchange of knowledge. Participants self-report that these events help them in both their day-to-day research as well as their careers. Based on our results, we conclude that hack weeks present an effective, easy-to-implement, fairly low-cost tool to positively impact data analysis literacy in academic disciplines, foster collaboration, and cultivate best practices.},

Most of the forecasts for cosmological parameters in galaxy clustering studies rely on the Fisher matrix approach for large-scale experiments like DES, Euclid, or SKA. Here we improve upon the standard method by taking into account three effects: the finite window function, the correlation between redshift bins, and the uncertainty on the bin redshift. The first two effects are negligible only in the limit of infinite surveys. The third effect, on the contrary, is negligible for infinitely small bins. Here we show how to take into account these effects and what the impact on forecasts of a Euclid-type experiment will be. The main result of this article is that the windowing and the bin cross-correlation induce a considerable change in the forecasted errors, of the order of 10-30{\%} for most cosmological parameters, while the redshift bin uncertainty can be neglected for bins smaller than ∆z = 0.1 roughly.},

Besides, CMB polarization produced by gravitational lensing has a large amount of information about the growth of matter fluctuations at late time. In this paper, we investigate their sensitivities to the impact of neutrino property on the growth of density fluctuations, such as the total neutrino mass, the effective number of neutrino species (extra radiation), and the neutrino mass hierarchy. We show that by combining a precise CMB polarization observation such as Simons Array with a 21 cm line observation such as Square kilometer Array (SKA) phase 1 and a baryon acoustic oscillation observation (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument:DESI) we can measure effects of non-zero neutrino mass on the growth of density fluctuation if the total neutrino mass is larger than 0.1 eV. Additionally, the combinations can strongly improve errors of the bounds on the effective number of neutrino species $\sigma$ (N$\nu$) ∼ 0.06-0.09 at 95 {\%} C.L.. Finally, by using SKA phase 2, we can determine the neutrino mass hierarchy at 95 {\%} C.L. if the total neutrino mass is similar to or smaller than 0.1 eV.},

Furthermore, eBOSS will provide improved tests of General Relativity on cosmological scales through redshift-space distortion measurements, improved tests for non-Gaussianity in the primordial density field, and new constraints on the summed mass of all neutrino species.

abstract = {Intrinsically bright galaxies appear systematically more correlated than faint galaxies in the Center for Astrophysics redshift survey. The amplification of the 2-point correlation function behaves exponentially with luminosity, being essentially flat up to the knee of the luminosity function, then increasing markedly. The amplification reaches a factor of 3.5e ±0 * 4 in the very brightest galaxies. The effect is dominated by spirals rather than ellipticals, so that the correlation function of bright spirals becomes comparable to that of normal ellipticals. Similar results are obtained whether the correlation function is measured in two or three dimensions. The effect persists to separations of a correlation length or more, and is not confined to the cores of the Virgo, Coma, and Abell 1367 clusters, suggesting that the effect is caused by biasing, that is, galaxies kindle preferentially in more clustered regions, rather than by gravitational relaxation.},

abstract = {Photometric large scale structure (LSS) surveys probe the largest volumes in the Universe, but are inevitably limited by systematic uncertainties. Imperfect photometric calibration leads to biases in our measurements of the density fields of LSS tracers such as galaxies and quasars, and as a result in cosmological parameter estimation. Earlier studies have proposed using cross-correlations between different redshift slices or cross-correlations between different surveys to reduce the effects of such systematics. In this paper we develop a method to characterize unknown systematics. We demonstrate that while we do not have sufficient information to correct for unknown systematics in the data, we can obtain an estimate of their magnitude. We define a parameter to estimate contamination from unknown systematics using cross-correlations between different redshift slices and propose discarding bins in the angular power spectrum that lie outside a certain contamination tolerance level. We show that this method improves estimates of the bias using simulated data and further apply it to photometric luminous red galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey as a case study. {\textcopyright} 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd and Sissa Medialab srl.},

abstract = {We present the large-scale correlation function measured from a spectroscopic sample of 46,748 luminous red galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The survey region covers 0.72 h{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}} Gpc{\^{}}3 over 3816 square degrees and 0.16{\textless}z{\textless}0.47, making it the best sample yet for the study of large-scale structure. We find a well-detected peak in the correlation function at 100h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}} Mpc separation that is an excellent match to the predicted shape and location of the imprint of the recombination-epoch acoustic oscillations on the low-redshift clustering of matter. This detection demonstrates the linear growth of structure by gravitational instability between z=1000 and the present and confirms a firm prediction of the standard cosmological theory. The acoustic peak provides a standard ruler by which we can measure the ratio of the distances to z=0.35 and z=1089 to 4{\%} fractional accuracy and the absolute distance to z=0.35 to 5{\%} accuracy. From the overall shape of the correlation function, we measure the matter density Omega{\_}mh{\^{}}2 to 8{\%} and find agreement with the value from cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies. Independent of the constraints provided by the CMB acoustic scale, we find Omega{\_}m = 0.273 +- 0.025 + 0.123 (1+w{\_}0) + 0.137 Omega{\_}K. Including the CMB acoustic scale, we find that the spatial curvature is Omega{\_}K=-0.010+-0.009 if the dark energy is a cosmological constant. More generally, our results provide a measurement of cosmological distance, and hence an argument for dark energy, based on a geometric method with the same simple physics as the microwave background anisotropies. The standard cosmological model convincingly passes these new and robust tests of its fundamental properties.},

abstract = {DESI (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument) is a Stage IV ground-based dark energy experiment that will study baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and the growth of structure through redshift-space distortions with a wide-area galaxy and quasar redshift survey. To trace the underlying dark matter distribution, spectroscopic targets will be selected in four classes from imaging data. We will measure luminous red galaxies up to z = 1.0. To probe the Universe out to even higher redshift, DESI will target bright [O II] emission line galaxies up to z = 1.7. Quasars will be targeted both as direct tracers of the underlying dark matter distribution and, at higher redshifts (2.1 {\textless} z {\textless} 3.5), for the Ly-$\alpha$ forest absorption features in their spectra, which will be used to trace the distribution of neutral hydrogen. When moonlight prevents efficient observations of the faint targets of the baseline survey, DESI will conduct a magnitude-limited Bright Galaxy Survey comprising approximately 10 million galaxies with a median z ≈ 0.2. In total, more than 30 million galaxy and quasar redshifts will be obtained to measure the BAO feature and determine the matter power spectrum, including redshift space distortions. 2},

They are based upon a physically well-motivated separation of the effects of acoustic oscillations, Compton drag, velocity overshoot, baryon infall, adiabatic damping, Silk damping, and cold-dark-matter growth suppression. We also find a simpler, more accurate, and better motivated form for the zero baryon transfer function than previous works. These descriptions are employed to quantify the amplitude and location of baryonic features in linear theory. While baryonic oscillations are prominent if the baryon fraction Ω b /Ω 0 ∼ {\textgreater} Ω 0 h 2 + 0.2, the main effect in more conventional cosmologies is a sharp suppression in the transfer function below the sound horizon. We provide a simple but accurate description of this effect and stress that it is not well approximated by a change in the shape parameter $\Gamma$.

abstract = {This paper is the first in a set that analyses the covariance matrices of clustering statistics obtained from several approximate methods for gravitational structure formation. We focus here on the covariance matrices of anisotropic two-point correlation function measurements. Our comparison includes seven approximate methods, which can be divided into three categories: predictive methods that follow the evolution of the linear density field deterministically (ICE-COLA, Peak Patch, and Pinocchio), methods that require a calibration with N-body simulations (Patchy and Halogen), and simpler recipes based on assumptions regarding the shape of the probability distribution function (PDF) of density fluctuations (log-normal and Gaussian density fields). We analyse the impact of using covariance estimates obtained from these approximate methods on cosmological analyses of galaxy clustering measurements, using as a reference the covariances inferred from a set of full N-body simulations. We find that all approximate methods can accurately recover the mean parameter values in-2 M. Lippich et al. ferred using the N-body covariances. The obtained parameter uncertainties typically agree with the corresponding N-body results within 5{\%} for our lower mass threshold, and 10{\%} for our higher mass threshold. Furthermore, we find that the constraints for some methods can differ by up to 20{\%} depending on whether the halo samples used to define the covariance matrices are defined by matching the mass, number density, or clustering amplitude of the parent N-body samples. The results of our configuration-space analysis indicate that most approximate methods provide similar results, with no single method clearly outperforming the others.},

abstract = {Aims. The maximum-likelihood method is the standard approach to obtain model fits to observational data and the corresponding confidence regions. We investigate possible sources of bias in the log-likelihood function and its subsequent analysis, focusing on estimators of the inverse covariance matrix. Furthermore, we study under which circumstances the estimated covariance matrix is invertible. Methods. We perform Monte-Carlo simulations to investigate the behaviour of estimators for the inverse covariance matrix, depending on the number of independent data sets and the number of variables of the data vectors. Results. We find that the inverse of the maximum-likelihood estimator of the covariance is biased, the amount of bias depending on the ratio of the number of bins (data vector variables), p, to the number of data sets, n. This bias inevitably leads to an - in extreme cases catastrophic - underestimation of the size of confidence regions. We report on a method to remove this bias for the idealised case of Gaussian noise and statistically independent data vectors. Moreover, we demonstrate that marginalisation over parameters introduces a bias into the marginalised log-likelihood function. Measures of the sizes of confidence regions suffer from the same problem. Furthermore, we give an analytic proof for the fact that the estimated covariance matrix is singular if p {\textgreater} n. {\textcopyright} ESO 2007.},

It uses only three map-resolution spherical harmonic transforms per parameter and applies to any data set with full sky or a partial sky coverage. We apply this method to Planck SMICA-2015 and obtain fluctuation map for six cosmological parameters. Our estimate shows that the Planck data is consistent with a single global value of the cosmological parameters and is not influenced by any severe local contaminations.
